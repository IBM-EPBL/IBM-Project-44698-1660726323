1.Consider a list at the position and print the list.
     Program:

             Mylist=[1,4,2,3,6,5] 
             Print(Mylist)
Remove first occurence of the list
       Program:

             Mylist=[1,4,2,3,6,5]
             Mylist.remove(Mylist[0])
             Print(Mylist)
Append integer at the end of the list
         Program:

              Mylist=[1,4,2,3,6,5] 
              Mylist.append(7)
             Print(Mylist)
Sort the list
          Program:
               
              Mylist=[1,4,2,3,6,5] 
              Mylist.sort()
              Print(Mylist)
Pop the last element of the list
              program:

                Mylist=[1,4,2,3,6,5] 
                Mylist.pop(5)
                Print(Mylist)
Reverse the List
        Program:
               Mylist=[1,4,2,3,6,5] 
              Mylist.reverse()
             Print(Mylist)

2.Write a claculator program in python?
        Program:

# Program make a simple calculator

# This function adds two numbers
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# This function subtracts two numbers
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

# This function multiplies two numbers
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# This function divides two numbers
def divide(x, y):
    return x / y


print("Select operation.")
print("1.Add")
print("2.Subtract")
print("3.Multiply")
print("4.Divide")

while True:
    # take input from the user
    choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4): ")

    # check if choice is one of the four options
    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):
        num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

        if choice == '1':
            print(num1, "+", num2, "=", add(num1, num2))

        elif choice == '2':
            print(num1, "-", num2, "=", subtract(num1, num2))

        elif choice == '3':
            print(num1, "*", num2, "=", multiply(num1, num2))

        elif choice == '4':
            print(num1, "/", num2, "=", divide(num1, num2))
        
        # check if user wants another calculation
        # break the while loop if answer is no
        next_calculation = input("Let's do next calculation? (yes/no): ")
        if next_calculation == "no":
          break
    
    else:
        print("invalid input")

3.Write a program to Concatenate ,reverse and slice a string?

        String Program
            str="Hello"
            print(str)
Slicing a string
            str="Hello"
            Print(str[1:3])
Concatenate a string
            str1="Hello"
            str2="World
            str=str1+str2
            Print(str)
Reverse  a string
        str="Hello World"[::-1]
        print(str)

4.Why is python apopular programming language?
        Python language is incredibly easy to use and learn for new beginners and newcomers. 
The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because 
it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language.
Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster 
than other programming languages.

5.What are the other frame works that can be used with python?
  The other frame works that can be used with python are listed below
   1.Django.
   2.Web2Py.
   3.Flask.
   4.Bottle.
   5.CherryPy.
6.What is the full form of WSGI?
   The full form of WSGI is WEB SERVER GATEWAY INTERFACE.
   The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI, pronounced whiskey or WIZ-ghee) is a simple calling convention for web servers 
to forward requests to web applications or frameworks written in the Python programming language.
